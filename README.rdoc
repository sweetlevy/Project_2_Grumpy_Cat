Application Name: "Stick-IT"

This application was created for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) course. This application is currently in development. This project is Project 2 of the WDI course, a Team Project of Team Name "Grumpy Cat". Team Members are: Charlye Tran, Francis Castillo, Sean Jennings Jr and Sarit Levy.

The purpose of this application is to be a whiteboard for teamwork collaborations.  This idea
was inspired by the colorful post-it notes posted on white walls and used to organize the various pieces of information collected by User Experience Design students/professionals gathered from their user experience research of website design.

The current features of this application include:

- User can sign up for an account or log-in to their Stick-IT account

- When logged-in:
    - a user can create a board and add stick-its to it
    - a user can view the boards s/he created with the stick-its
      that are attached to those boards
    - a user can add collaborators as team members so that the user
      and collaborators can work on the board together and add stick-its to it
    - a user can add categories and colors to the stick-its to help organize them
    - a user can move stick-its from one category area to another and the color
      of the stick-it will change and match the color of its new category
    - a user can delete stick-its
    - a user can delete a board
    - a user can edit their account information

- Some of the features that are currently in development:
    - a user will be able to take a snapshot of his/her board to be able to
      use it as a visual reference
    - a user will be able to revert back to an older (saved) version of a board
    - a user will be able to isolate a specific group of stick-its for later use
